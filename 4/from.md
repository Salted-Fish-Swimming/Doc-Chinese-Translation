# Affine logic

Affine logic is a [substructural logic](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Philosophy:Substructural_logic) whose proof theory rejects the [structural rule](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Structural_rule) of [contraction](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Philosophy:Idempotency_of_entailment). It can also be characterized as [linear logic](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Linear_logic) with [weakening](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Philosophy:Monotonicity_of_entailment). The name "affine logic" is associated with [linear logic](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Linear_logic), to which it differs by allowing the weakening rule. [Jean-Yves Girard](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Biography:Jean-Yves_Girard) introduced the name as part of the [geometry of interaction](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Geometry_of_interaction) semantics of linear logic, which characterizes linear logic in terms of [linear algebra](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Linear_algebra); here he alludes to [affine transformations](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Affine_transformation) on [vector spaces](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Vector_space).[1]

Affine logic predated linear logic. V. N. Grishin used this logic in 1974,[2] after observing that [Russell's paradox](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox) cannot be derived in a [set theory](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Set_theory) without contraction, even with an unbounded comprehension axiom.[3] Likewise, the logic formed the basis of a [decidable](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Philosophy:Decidability_(logic)) sub-theory of predicate logic, called 'Direct logic' (Ketonen & Wehrauch, 1984; Ketonen & Bellin, 1989).

Affine logic can be embedded into linear logic by rewriting the affine arrow $\displaystyle{ A \rightarrow B }$ as the linear arrow $\displaystyle{ A \multimap B \otimes \top }$.

Whereas full linear logic (i.e. propositional linear logic with multiplicatives, additives, and exponentials) is undecidable, full affine logic is decidable.

Affine logic forms the foundation of [ludics](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Ludics).
